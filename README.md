## About

This repo is to tag images using computer vision APIs provided by (Imagga)[https://imagga.com/] 

What is Imagga image tagging?

Go to the home page of Imagga. 

Under "Solutions" you can see the various services offered. We will use the Tagging feature.The tagging feature enables automatic assignment of relevant tags or keywords to images and videos. 

Check out the demo. Use one of the demo images. See the tags generated for this image by Imagga. 


## Getting set-up 

### Install Python 

To check if your computer already has Python installed, try the below on Terminal (for Mac) or Command Prompt (for Windows):

```
python --version
```

If you see a Python version returned (like 3.8.2), you already have Python !

Windows: Follow this you-tube video and install Python 3.x on your machine. Go ahead click on the image below:

### Install the packages

Your default Python installation may not have some of the packages needed to run this code.  The list of the required packages is in the requirements.txt file in the code repo. 

To install these packages run the below command on the Terminal (for Mac) or Command Prompt (for Windows): 

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Get an Imagga API Key

To access the Imagga API, we need to get the Imagga API key and secret. 

First, create an account on Imagga. Login to the account and go to the Dashboard. 

Take note of the API KEY and SECRET. This is like your username and password. Note that you need the API Key and SECRET to access the API.

### Update the config.py file with your API KEY and SECRET

You need to create a file called config.py with your API KEY and SECRET in the rep home folder - this is where the code file tagging.py exists. 

Paste this into the config.py file. Update the file with your API KEY and SECRET. 

api_key="YOUR_API_KEY"
api_secret = "YOUR_API_SECRET"

## Running the Code 

To run the code, just use the below on your Terminal (Mac) or Command prompt (Win):

```
python tagging.py --image='afg-1960s.jpg'
```

This will print the top tags generated by Imagga for the image. 

### Interpreting the Outcome 

Sample Output is below: 


```{}
('Uploading image to Imagga: ', 'images/afg-1960s.jpg')
	 Upload successful
Tagging the image:
	 Tagging successful
	 Top tags (confidence score):
	 pedestrian 37.8
	 street 37.7
	 city 29.1
	 sidewalk 26.7
	 tourist 26.2
Deleting image from Imagga:
	 Delete successful
```

The code calls 3 Imagga APIs:
- Upload: To upload the image to Imagga 
- Tag: Generate the tags for the image
- Delete: The delete the file from Imagga 

The tag API returns a JSON object. The JSON object is parsed in the code to output the top tags and the associated confidence score (for each tag). 

This output printed on the screen.
